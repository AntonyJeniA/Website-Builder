# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The Visual Web Builder is a drag-and-drop web development tool that allows users to create websites visually without writing code. The tool provides a three-panel interface: a left panel with draggable HTML elements, a center canvas for building the website, and a right panel for customizing styles and properties. Users can drag elements from the left panel to the center canvas, customize their appearance using the right panel, and preview their creation with a demo button.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a web designer, I want to drag HTML elements from a component library to a canvas, so that I can visually build web pages without writing code.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the application loads THEN the system SHALL display a left panel containing draggable HTML elements (div, paragraph, heading, image, button, input, etc.)
2. WHEN a user clicks and drags an element from the left panel THEN the system SHALL provide visual feedback showing the element being dragged
3. WHEN a user drags an element over the center canvas THEN the system SHALL show drop zones and insertion indicators
4. WHEN a user drops an element on the canvas THEN the system SHALL add the element to the canvas at the specified location
5. WHEN an element is dropped THEN the system SHALL generate appropriate HTML structure with unique identifiers

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a web designer, I want to customize the appearance and properties of elements I've placed on the canvas, so that I can create the exact design I envision.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user clicks on an element in the canvas THEN the system SHALL highlight the selected element and display its properties in the right panel
2. WHEN a user modifies CSS properties in the right panel THEN the system SHALL immediately apply changes to the selected element in the canvas
3. WHEN customizing an element THEN the system SHALL provide controls for common CSS properties (color, background, font, size, margin, padding, border)
4. WHEN editing text content THEN the system SHALL allow inline editing or provide a text input field in the properties panel
5. WHEN modifying properties THEN the system SHALL maintain a live preview of changes

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a web designer, I want to see a live preview of my website as I build it, so that I can understand how it will look to end users.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the application loads THEN the system SHALL display a center canvas that renders HTML elements as they would appear in a browser
2. WHEN elements are added or modified THEN the system SHALL update the canvas view in real-time
3. WHEN a user clicks a "Demo" or "Preview" button THEN the system SHALL open the current design in a new window or full-screen mode
4. WHEN in preview mode THEN the system SHALL hide all editing interfaces and show only the created content
5. WHEN in preview mode THEN the system SHALL allow users to interact with functional elements (buttons, links, forms)

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a web designer, I want to organize and structure my page elements hierarchically, so that I can create complex layouts and maintain proper HTML structure.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN elements are nested within containers THEN the system SHALL maintain proper parent-child relationships
2. WHEN a user drags an element over a container element THEN the system SHALL indicate whether the element can be dropped inside the container
3. WHEN elements are selected THEN the system SHALL show the element hierarchy or breadcrumb navigation
4. WHEN a user deletes a parent element THEN the system SHALL handle child elements appropriately (delete or move to parent container)
5. WHEN elements are reordered THEN the system SHALL update the DOM structure accordingly

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a web designer, I want to save and load my website projects, so that I can work on them over multiple sessions.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user clicks save THEN the system SHALL serialize the current canvas state to JSON format
2. WHEN a user loads a project THEN the system SHALL reconstruct the canvas from the saved JSON data
3. WHEN saving THEN the system SHALL preserve all element properties, styles, and hierarchy
4. WHEN loading THEN the system SHALL restore all visual elements and their customizations
5. WHEN the browser is refreshed THEN the system SHALL attempt to restore the last working state from local storage

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a web designer, I want to export my created website as clean HTML/CSS files, so that I can use the code in production or other tools.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user clicks export THEN the system SHALL generate clean HTML markup from the canvas content
2. WHEN exporting THEN the system SHALL create a separate CSS file with all applied styles
3. WHEN generating code THEN the system SHALL use semantic HTML elements and clean class names
4. WHEN exporting THEN the system SHALL provide options to download the files or copy the code to clipboard
5. WHEN code is generated THEN the system SHALL ensure the exported HTML is valid and properly formatted

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a web designer, I want responsive design capabilities, so that I can create websites that work on different screen sizes.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN designing THEN the system SHALL provide viewport size controls (desktop, tablet, mobile)
2. WHEN switching viewport sizes THEN the system SHALL adjust the canvas dimensions accordingly
3. WHEN in different viewports THEN the system SHALL allow setting different CSS properties for responsive breakpoints
4. WHEN exporting THEN the system SHALL include appropriate media queries in the generated CSS
5. WHEN previewing THEN the system SHALL allow testing the design at different screen sizes
